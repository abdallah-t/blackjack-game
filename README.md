Welcome to the **Blackjack Game**! This is a Python-based implementation of the classic casino card game Blackjack. Test your luck and strategy in this exciting game of chance.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script `blackjack.py` to start the game.
2. You will be dealt two cards from a standard deck.
3. Your goal is to have a hand that adds up to a higher score than the dealer's hand, without exceeding 21 points.
4. The value of cards 2 through 10 is their numerical value. Face cards (J, Q, K) are worth 10 points each, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 points.
5. You can choose to draw additional cards ("hit") or pass ("stand"). If your hand exceeds 21 points, you bust and lose the game.
6. Once you decide to pass, the dealer will play their turn. The dealer must draw cards until their hand totals at least 17 points.
7. The winner is determined based on the scores of the hands. If your hand is closer to 21 than the dealer's, you win!
